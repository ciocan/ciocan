## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Radu, a software developer based in London, UK.

I'm a T-shaped developer, with a strong focus on UX and product development.
I like to build cool stuff and learn new things. Some of them are still online.

Profesionally, I usually work with early stage startups, helping them build products from 0 to 1.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently building on [SICAP](https://sicap.ai) - a search app for the public sector to find information about the Romanian government procurement spending.
  - it's built with Next.js and Elasticsearch and it stores more than 100gb of public procurement data.
  - frontend hosted on Vercel and the Elasticsearch cluster is hosted using docker swarm with 3 nodes.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about ETL processes and data platforms (especially [Meltano](https://github.com/meltano/meltano) and [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core)).
  - check out my [PNRR minisite](https://pnrr.sicap.ai) about the Romanian PNRR program. It uses [evidence.dev](https://evidence.dev/) to power the data visualisations.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software development, product development, startups, or the Romanian government spending.
- ðŸ“« Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciocan/) or drop an email to ciocan@gmail
- âš¡ Fun fact: first time I use a linux shell was in 1994.
